# Rainbow ReadMe Generator

## Description
This project takes the guesswork out of what to include in a readme and aready formats everything in a clear and concise fashion.  It includes a working TOC, along with including badges and links to the licenses that are used.  I learned my way around using node js along with inquirer.  I was able to use what I learned in class to write the fucntion to actually save information to a file.
